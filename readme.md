# Overview

This project is a **Recipe Management System** developed in **C#**. The purpose of this software is to enhance my understanding of C# programming concepts, including object-oriented programming, file handling, and user interaction. By building this project, I aimed to improve my skills in designing interactive console applications and managing data persistence.

The program allows users to **add, search for, display, and delete** recipes. Additionally, recipes are stored in a text file, ensuring that data remains persistent between program executions.
